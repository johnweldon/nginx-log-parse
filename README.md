# nginx-log-parse

Nginx log parser is a little utility I wrote to scratch my own itch of parsing nginx logfiles.

There is a lot of work to do to make it a useful tool, but this version will read in a logfile from stdin and then dump out structured representation of the logs.


Thanks to the [Gopher Academy](http://blog.gopheracademy.com/advent-2014/parsers-lexers/) for the parser/lexer tutorial.
